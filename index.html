      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi viewer and fellow coders!

        I'm an active free lance graphic designer. I own several "grass-root” online businesses and I’m an avid  social media user and influencer. I use to be a molecular technologist, but quit due to professional disagreements and boredom. I often ask myself  how does one quit a job they committed most of their 20s too secure but that’s life. After ditching my job I committed to my businesses and entrepreneurship 100% and the journey was rough! During that journey of entrepreneurship I realized that web design and software development are essential because not only were my clients asking for me to program websites for them, I also needed the skills to build a custom website for my businesses. Despite having experience with template web building platforms like WIX and Squarespace, I realized the things I wanted and what my customers wanted was intricate. Then and there I knew this was something I couldn’t get around learning.
         
        On another note, when I was younger,  I was always fascinated with hacking my game consols to unlock its full potential. I eventually did small time (emphasis on small) coding for a video game start-up  that used scripts and I remembered loving it. Soon other obligations like college and life pulled me away from resuming that hobby. Here I am as an entrepreneur who has not been active in that world for over a decade and not having a solid avenue to get back into coding I felt helpless until the day I heard that my cousin landed a big job coding for a company in New York.  She shared the same job path as as me but altered from a bio lab to coding in under a year. It seemed like the universe timed this right because  after a conversation with her about educational programs for coding and researched it, I discovered Rutgers was offering an accelerated program for it. This was a perfect opportunity because not only did my situation call for it but I realized that I have spent most of my life in font of a computer, so I definitely have a passion for them! Coding and software development is right up my ally, which I have recently discovered is a secret passion of mine.   Now here I am a novice coder hungry to learn and sitting in one of the colleges I dreamed of going to since high school! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>North Bergen, NJ but I like to say I'm from New York City because I was born there and its more exciting :)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I draw professionally
        I also like to make EDM music (yes that loud sometimes annoying music)<br>
        I make videos (engineer them)<br>
        I cook occasionally<br> </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to do what I'm most passionate about whether it be; coding, producing/DJing, making movies, mechanical and virtual design (video games and 3D design).
        I plan to do these things without having to worry about bills or any financial restraints. I know it sounds crazy and off topic but besides my business dealing with all these things, all of them are related to each other and I can write a 12 page essay on how they are related lol.
        </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Englewood, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I aspire to be a web developer because I feel it is the basis of everything we do. You open up an iPhone everything has been coded to graphically represent what you see on the screen, almost like my favorite movie the Matrix! I also feel that coding is something that I have been indirectly avoiding my entire life just like music. ALSO being a web developer nowadays, I fell that the skill gives you a huge advantage in  the entrepreneur world and our present digital age alike.
